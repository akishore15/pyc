Hello, World!

The Hello, World! Program is a traditional program when you are learning how to code. Type this into your shell:

print("Hello, World!")

This line of code allows us to print out the line "Hello, World!" to the shell!

print()
---------------------------------------
The print() function in Python allows us to print out parameters inputed in by the developer. It can be any datatype in Python!
Activities:
1. Print out the string "I" followed by the string "3"
2. Print out jokes!
3. Print every letter in the alphabet

\n
------------
The \n is used to tell the computer that "Hey, I want to put everything after this \n into a new line." This \n is called a line feed or a new line index. The computer ignores it in the text and does what the
\n character says. 

ESCAPE! String Characters
