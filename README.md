This repository was dedicated to everyone who taught me how to code (my first coding language was Python) in Python. I really appreciate it, and now I want to teach more people. I really just want to teach.
It is an honor to teach us all this, and sure, C++ and JavaScript are better, but only in your opinion; Python is the universal tactic of IT, and it is how we power IT. You at least have to know Python to 
fundamentally know about all this IT and CS stuff. JavaScript has good roots too, but JavaScript is a bit less quality and quantity than Python, so we would need to honor Python, but what if you do not know 
Python? PYC, the GitHub repository, was made to acknowledge Python and teach it. I have an agreement with Python. You need to know it! This is why you should use PYC, to better learn.
